# Cognifyz Data Analysis Project

Welcome to the **Cognifyz Data Analysis Project**! This project involves analyzing a dataset containing restaurant information to derive insights that can help Cognifyz Technologies make data-driven decisions. The analysis is divided into three levels, each focusing on different aspects of the dataset.

## Level 1

### Task 1: Top Cuisines
- **Objective**: Identify the top three most common cuisines and calculate the percentage of restaurants that serve each of these cuisines.
- **Implementation**: 
    - We analyzed the dataset to find the most frequently occurring cuisines.
    - The percentage of restaurants offering each of these top cuisines was calculated to give insights into their popularity.

### Task 2: City Analysis
- **Objective**: Find the city with the highest number of restaurants, calculate the average rating for each city, and determine the city with the highest average rating.
- **Implementation**:
    - We identified the city with the most restaurants and computed the average rating for restaurants in each city.
    - This analysis provided insights into both restaurant distribution and the highest-rated cities.

### Task 3: Price Range Distribution
- **Objective**: Create a visual representation (histogram or bar chart) of the price range distribution and calculate the percentage of restaurants in each price range.
- **Implementation**:
    - We used visual tools to represent the distribution of restaurants across different price categories.
    - The percentage of restaurants in each price range was calculated to reveal pricing diversity.

### Task 4: Online Delivery
- **Objective**: Determine the percentage of restaurants that offer online delivery and compare the average ratings of restaurants with and without online delivery.
- **Implementation**:
    - We calculated the percentage of restaurants offering online delivery.
    - A comparison was made between the average ratings of restaurants that offer online delivery and those that donâ€™t.

## Level 2

### Task 1: Cuisine Combination
- **Objective**: Identify common combinations of cuisines and explore if certain combinations tend to have higher ratings.
- **Implementation**:
    - We identified the most frequent cuisine combinations and analyzed their ratings to determine any correlations between specific combinations and higher customer ratings.

### Task 2: Geographic Analysis
- **Objective**: Plot restaurant locations on a map using longitude and latitude coordinates and identify any spatial patterns or clusters.
- **Implementation**:
    - Using geographical coordinates, we visualized restaurant locations on a map to explore clustering patterns and analyze spatial restaurant distribution.

### Task 3: Restaurant Chains
- **Objective**: Identify restaurant chains in the dataset and analyze their ratings and popularity.
- **Implementation**:
    - We identified the presence of restaurant chains and analyzed their ratings, popularity, and performance compared to independent restaurants.

### Task 4: Restaurant Reviews
- **Objective**: Analyze text reviews to find common positive and negative keywords and determine if there is a relationship between review length and rating.
- **Implementation**:
    - Sentiment analysis was performed on the reviews to extract common positive and negative keywords.
    - We also explored the relationship between review length and restaurant rating to check if longer reviews are linked to higher or lower ratings.

## Level 3

### Task 1: Votes Analysis
- **Objective**: Identify the restaurants with the highest and lowest votes and analyze the correlation between the number of votes and the restaurant rating.
- **Implementation**:
    - We analyzed the data to find restaurants with the most and least votes.
    - We then studied the relationship between the number of votes and overall ratings to understand if restaurants with more votes tend to have better ratings.

### Task 2: Price Range vs. Online Delivery and Table Booking
- **Objective**: Analyze the relationship between the price range of restaurants and their availability of online delivery and table booking services.
- **Implementation**:
    - We studied whether higher-priced restaurants are more likely to offer online delivery and table booking.
    - This analysis helped identify if higher pricing influences the availability of these services.
